**4. Approval & AI Policy**
*   **Approved Hours:** The 50-hour requirement refers to *approved* hours, which may differ from *tracked* hours.
*   **AI Usage:** Generative AI is **allowed**, but quality matters.
    *   **"AI Slop":** Low-quality, unpolished code generated by AI (especially frontend) will result in hour deductions.
*   **Fraud:** Using bots/scripts to fake activity is strictly prohibited and may lead to a ban.
*   **Discrepancies:** If a simple project takes an unreasonable amount of time (e.g., 100 hours for a basic website), hours will be deducted.
*   **Best Practice:** Commit frequently (every hour) to substantiate your work.

**5. Submissions & Deadlines**
*   **Process:** Code -> Track on Hackatime -> Submit on Midnight website -> Wait for approval.
*   **Resubmission:** You can resubmit projects to keep working on them.
*   **Deadline:** The selection process ends on **December 31, 2025**.

**6. Travel Stipends**
*   **Rate:** After the initial 50 hours (for the invite), you earn travel stipends at a rate of **$10 per approved hour**.
*   **Example:** If your flight costs $800, you need: 50 hours (invite) + 80 hours (stipend) = 130 total hours.

**7. Visa Letters**
*   You can request a visa invitation letter after your **first project** is approved.
