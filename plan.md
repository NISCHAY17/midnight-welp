to do
prev a bot that works in a channel or in dm to respond to midnight event question 
this will be not official and will show it is not by offical team
it will have data from all the info given bwy hc team
first it gets q / text then i run it through a simple prompt to catogorise it 
the tetx into 10 or more premade ans 
if the q does not match those field call ai again to answer q with info base and then send it

also cool things i can add
make a plan for them to make a plan 
urm motivate them ? 

also cool if u can put wakaatime api key and get live stats on slack itself

to make - a slack bot / idk it will work or not
